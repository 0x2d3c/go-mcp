### Client Implementation

Here's a basic client implementation example showing how to create an MCP client, connect to a server, and perform basic operations:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"

    "github.com/ThinkInAIXYZ/go-mcp/client"
    "github.com/ThinkInAIXYZ/go-mcp/protocol"
    "github.com/ThinkInAIXYZ/go-mcp/transport"
)

func main() {
	// Create transport client (using SSE in this example)
	transportClient, err := transport.NewSSEClientTransport(context.Background(), "http://127.0.0.1:8080/sse")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to create transport client: %v", err)
	}

	// Create MCP client using transport
	mcpClient, err := client.NewClient(transportClient,
		// Optional: Set custom notification handler
		client.WithToolsListChangedNotifyHandler(func(ctx context.Context, notification *protocol.ToolListChangedNotification) error {
			fmt.Printf("Tool list updated: %+v\n", notification)
			return nil
		}),
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to create MCP client: %v", err)
	}
	defer mcpClient.Close()

	// Get server capabilities
	capabilities := mcpClient.GetServerCapabilities()
	fmt.Printf("Server capabilities: %+v\n", capabilities)

	// List available tools
	toolsResult, err := mcpClient.ListTools(context.Background())
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to list tools: %v", err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Available tools: %+v\n", toolsResult.Tools)

	// Call tool
	callResult, err := mcpClient.CallTool(context.Background(), protocol.NewCallToolRequest("example_tool", map[string]interface{}{
		"param1": "value1",
		"param2": 42,
	}))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to call tool: %v", err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Tool call result: %+v\n", callResult)
}
```

This example shows how to:
1. Create an SSE client transport
2. Initialize an MCP client and configure notification handlers
3. Get server capability information
4. List available tools
5. Call a specific tool and handle results

### Server Implementation

Here's a basic server implementation example showing how to create an MCP server, register tool handlers, and handle client requests:

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"time"

	"github.com/ThinkInAIXYZ/go-mcp/protocol"
	"github.com/ThinkInAIXYZ/go-mcp/server"
	"github.com/ThinkInAIXYZ/go-mcp/transport"
)

func main() {
	// Create transport server (using SSE in this example)
	transportServer, err := transport.NewSSEServerTransport("127.0.0.1:8080")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to create transport server: %v", err)
	}

	// Create MCP server using transport
	mcpServer, err := server.NewServer(transportServer,
		// Set server implementation information
		server.WithServerInfo(protocol.Implementation{
			Name:    "Example MCP Server",
			Version: "1.0.0",
		}),
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to create MCP server: %v", err)
	}

	// Register tool handler
	mcpServer.RegisterTool(&protocol.Tool{
		Name:        "current time",
		Description: "Get current time with timezone, Asia/Shanghai is default",
		InputSchema: protocol.InputSchema{
			Type: protocol.Object,
			Properties: map[string]interface{}{
				"timezone": map[string]string{
					"type":        "string",
					"description": "current time timezone",
				},
			},
			Required: []string{"timezone"},
		},
	}, func(req *protocol.CallToolRequest) (*protocol.CallToolResult, error) {
		timezone, ok := req.Arguments["timezone"].(string)
		if !ok {
			return nil, errors.New("timezone must be a string")
		}

		loc, err := time.LoadLocation(timezone)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("parse timezone with error: %v", err)
		}
		text := fmt.Sprintf(`current time is %s`, time.Now().In(loc))

		return &protocol.CallToolResult{
			Content: []protocol.Content{
				protocol.TextContent{
					Type: "text",
					Text: text,
				},
			},
		}, nil
	})

	if err = mcpServer.Run(); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to start MCP server: %v", err)
		return
	}
}

```

This example shows how to:
1. Create an SSE transport server
2. Initialize an MCP server and configure server information and capabilities
3. Register tool handlers
4. Start HTTP server to handle client connections

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design

The Go-MCP SDK adopts a clear layered architecture design, ensuring code modularity, extensibility, and maintainability. Through a deep understanding of this architecture, developers can better utilize all SDK features and even customize and extend according to their needs.

### Three-Layer Architecture

Go-MCP's architecture can be abstracted into three main layers:

![img.png](docs/images/img.png)

1. **Transport Layer**: Handles underlying communication, supporting different transport protocols
2. **Protocol Layer**: Implements all MCP protocol functionality and data structures
3. **User Layer**: Includes server and client implementations, providing user-facing APIs

This layered design decouples layers from each other, allowing independent evolution and replacement while maintaining overall functionality consistency.

### Transport Layer

The transport layer handles underlying communication details, currently supporting two main transport methods:

![img_1.png](docs/images/img_1.png)

- **HTTP SSE/POST**: HTTP-based server-sent events and POST requests, suitable for network communication
- **Stdio**: Standard input/output stream-based communication, suitable for inter-process communication

The transport layer abstracts through a unified interface, so upper-layer code doesn't need to care about specific transport implementation details. This design allows easy addition of new transport methods, such as WebSocket, gRPC, etc., without affecting upper-layer code.

### Protocol Layer

The protocol layer is the core of Go-MCP, containing all MCP protocol-related definitions, including:

- Data structure definitions
- Request construction
- Response parsing
- Notification handling

The protocol layer implements all functionality defined in the MCP specification, including but not limited to:

- Initialization (Initialize)
- Heartbeat detection (Ping)
- Cancellation operations (Cancellation)
- Progress notifications (Progress)
- Root resource management (Roots)
- Sampling control (Sampling)
- Prompt management (Prompts)
- Resource management (Resources)
- Tool invocation (Tools)
- Completion requests (Completion)
- Logging (Logging)
- Pagination handling (Pagination)

The protocol layer is decoupled from the transport layer through the transport interface, allowing protocol implementation to be independent of specific transport methods.

### User Layer

The user layer includes server and client implementations, providing developer-friendly APIs:

- **Server Implementation**: Handles requests from clients, provides resources and tools, sends notifications
- **Client Implementation**: Connects to server, sends requests, handles responses and notifications

The user layer's design philosophy is to provide synchronous request-response patterns, even if the underlying implementation may be asynchronous. This design makes the API more intuitive and easier to use while maintaining efficient asynchronous processing capabilities.

### Message Processing Flow

In Go-MCP, messages can be abstracted into three types:

1. **Request**: Request messages sent from client to server
2. **Response**: Response messages returned from server to client
3. **Notification**: One-way notification messages that can be sent by server or client

Both server and client have sending and receiving capabilities:

- **Sending Capability**: Includes sending messages (requests, responses, notifications) and matching requests with responses
- **Receiving Capability**: Includes routing messages (requests, responses, notifications) and asynchronous/synchronous processing

### Project Structure

Go-MCP's project structure clearly reflects its architectural design:

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ log.go                 # Log interface definitions
```

This structure makes code organization clear and easy for developers to understand and extend.
